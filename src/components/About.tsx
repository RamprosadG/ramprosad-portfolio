        Hello! I'm Ramprosad Gharami â€” a Software Engineer and Competitive
        Programmer with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from
        Gopalganj Science and Technology University. I specialize in building
        modern full-stack web applications using modern technologies like
        JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB
        etc. My work spans from real-time applications with WebSockets to secure
        payment gateway integrations such as Paddle and UddoktaPay. With a
        strong foundation in problem-solving and practical software development,
        I focus on writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code. I'm deeply
        passionate about continuous learning and staying updated with emerging
        technologies. Outside of coding, I actively participate in competitive
        programming, enjoy fast typing, and engage with tech communities. I'm
        always open to collaborating on impactful and technically challenging
        projects. Let's build something amazing together!
