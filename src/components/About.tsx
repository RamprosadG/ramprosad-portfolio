        About Me
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed mb-8 text-justify">
        Hello! I'm Ramprosad Gharami â€” a Software Engineer and Competitive
        Programmer with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from
        Gopalganj Science and Technology University. I specialize in building
        modern full-stack web applications using technologies like Node.js,
        React.js, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. My work spans from real-time
        applications with WebSockets to secure payment gateway integrations such
        as Paddle and UddoktaPay. With a strong foundation in problem-solving
        and practical software development, I focus on writing clean, scalable,
        and maintainable code. I'm deeply passionate about continuous learning
        and staying updated with emerging technologies. Outside of coding, I
        actively participate in competitive programming, enjoy fast typing, and
        engage with tech communities. I'm always open to collaborating on
        impactful and technically challenging projects. Let's build something
        amazing together!
